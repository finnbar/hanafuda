Here is a list of tasks that will make the game actually work or make it better.

## Coding stuff to do

Other stuff
 - [ ] Allow people to be randomly matched with opponents
 - [ ] Say whose go it is.
 - [ ] Add combinations to the scoring message
 - [ ] Add more tests
 - [ ] Remove the local variable from the scoring
 - [ ] Refactor some code so it is shorter

 - [ ] Use only alphabetic characters as card symbols
 - [ ] Either allow non alphabetic characters in username or stop it crashing the server
 - [ ] Prevent against the server being crashed by bad messages generally
 - [ ] Add debug output to the server
 - [x] Add something to check message is received.
 - [x] Add choice of whether it is connecting to proper server or local to client

Allow multiple games as part of a longer matched
 - [ ] Allow match type to be chosen at the beginning by player 1
 - [ ] Move all game initialisation stuff in the client into one function
 - [ ] Add a new gamestate for end of this match
 - [ ] Add match information to the gameover gamestate
 - [ ] Allow both users to choose whether to continue the match
 - [ ] Store matches rather than games in the server
 - [ ] Update match and reset game on server

Weird bugs

  - [x] Change tween implementation to use dictionary-tables instead of list-tables
  - [x] Make moving thing glide on top of the deck instead of under it

Weird bugs
  - [x] Sometimes moves don't seem to be verified, and I'm not yet sure why.
        Examples: `]

  - [x] Doesn't seem to like second moves (client) and third moves (server)
  - [x] The scoring thing seems to be annoyed at me for giving insert wrong number of arguments when scoring bigs?
