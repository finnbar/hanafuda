Other stuff
 - [x] Get it to shuffle cards *differently* each time
 - [x] Separate client code and server code into folders
 - [x] Rewrite tweens to get them to land more accurately
 - [x] Make the empty card a bit less horrible and ideally transparent in centre
 - [x] Set selected card to nil when game update is received
 - [x] Move all cards in hand along or move arrows to above cards or both
 - [x] Implement multipliers.
 - [ ] Allow people to be randomly matched with opponents
 - [ ] Allow playing multiple games as part of a longer match
 - [x] Split server into different files because it is long
 - [x] Remove arrows from cards when in deck flip mode
 - [x] Change the overlay for scoring to black on white or white on black
 - [x] Move the hand cards along when one is played

 - [ ] Add combinations to the scoring message
 - [x] Change tween implementation to use dictionary-tables instead of list-tables
 - [x] Make moving thing glide on top of the deck instead of under it

Weird bugs
 - [x] Sometimes moves don't seem to be verified, and I'm not yet sure why.
       Examples: `]
 - [x] Deck selection doesn't work.
 - [x] Doesn't seem to like second moves (client) and third moves (server)
 - [x] The scoring thing seems to be annoyed at me for giving insert wrong number of arguments when scoring bigs?
